#  InMyPDF – Agentic Multimodal RAG System

InMyPDF is an AI-powered Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to intelligently understand and query PDF documents using multimodal ingestion pipelines, vector search, and LLM-powered reasoning.

The platform processes text, tables, and image-based content from PDFs, converts them into vector embeddings, and enables users to ask natural language questions through an intelligent AI agent interface.

Built using FastAPI, LangChain, FAISS, Sentence Transformers, OpenAI models, and multimodal document ingestion pipelines.

#  AI Architecture

InMyPDF combines multiple AI and NLP components into a unified Agentic RAG pipeline.

The system:
1. Extracts multimodal document content
2. Splits documents into semantic chunks
3. Converts chunks into vector embeddings
4. Stores vectors in FAISS
5. Uses retrieval tools with LangChain agents
6. Generates grounded answers using LLMs

This architecture enables:
- Context-aware querying
- Intelligent document understanding
- Semantic retrieval
- AI-assisted reasoning

#  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

The system uses a RAG pipeline to:
- Reduce hallucinations
- Improve factual grounding
- Retrieve only relevant document context
- Generate context-aware answers

Unlike traditional chatbots, InMyPDF answers questions based on uploaded documents instead of general internet knowledge.
